# OOP_assigment_1
 
 In this project we built 2 cllases that implements the interface that we given.
 
 The interfaces based on the Observer design pattern we learned in the course.
 
 The code we worte has been based on previous assignment on UndoableStringBuilders, in this assigment we wanted to notify the subscribers about evry change we made in the  UndoableStringBuilders.
 
 In the second part of the assignment we made test with Junit and we used an new library named JvmUtilities that help us to get information about the heap and th storage we used in the project.
